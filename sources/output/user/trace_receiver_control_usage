    $command$ [options] action1 ... actionN

where any action may be:
    
    --start <trace-directory>
        start trace reciever, and wait until it is initialized.
        
        <trace-directory> is a directory where trace should be stored.
        
        Directory may contain "%u" characters sequence, which will be
        replaced with string representation of UUID of the trace stored.
    
    --stop
        stop trace reciever, and wait until it is exited.
    
    --init-session <server-addr>
        send 'start' signal to the server with given address, and wait
        until session is started.
        
        Address is internet address of the server.
        
        Also server port may be specified after ':'. Otherwise default
        server port is used ($SERVER_PORT$).
    --break-session <server-addr>
        send 'stop' signal to the server with given address, and wait
        until session is broken.
        
        Format of the address is the same as for --init-session action.
    
    --start-trace

    --receiver-port=<number>
        port on which trace reciever is operate/will be operate after start.
