Usage:

    $command$ [options] action1 ... actionN

where any action may be:
    
    --start <trace-directory>
        start trace receiver, and wait until it is initialized.
        
        <trace-directory> is a directory where trace should be stored.
        
        Directory may contain "%u" characters sequence, which will be
        replaced with string representation of UUID of the trace stored.
    
    --stop
        stop trace receiver, and wait until it exits.
    
    --init-session <server-addr>
        send 'start' signal to the server with given address, and wait
        until the session is started.
        
        Address is the IP address of the server.
        
        The server port may be specified after ':'. Otherwise, the default
        server port is used ($SERVER_PORT$).
    --break-session <server-addr>
        send 'stop' signal to the server with given address, and wait
        until the session is broken.
        
        Format of the address is the same as for --init-session action.
    
    --start-trace
        wait until transmission of any trace begins.
        In case of already transmitted trace immidiately returns.
    
    --stop-trace
        wait until transmission of current trace ends.
        Returns immediately if no trace is currently transmitted.
    
Options may be follows:

    --receiver-port=<number>
        port on which trace receiver is operating/will be operating after 
        start.
        If not given, default value $RECEIVER_PORT$ is used.
        
        If there are several such options, the last one takes effect.

Development options:

    --receiver-path=<path>
        Path to the receiver program.
