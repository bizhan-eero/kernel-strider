KernelStrider
--------------
KernelStrider project provides the tools to collect data about the 
operation of Linux kernel modules (device drivers, file system modules,
etc.) in runtime. Among other things, the tools collect information about
the memory accesses and function calls that the target kernel module makes.
The information is passed to the user space for further processing.

To achieve this, KernelStrider implements relatively lightweight binary 
instrumentation facilities for the kernel modules.

One of many possible usage areas for KernelStrider is providing data for 
offline data race detectors. This should allow detecting the concurrency
issues of this kind in kernel modules.

Currently, KernelStrider is intended for systems with x86 architecture, 
both 32- and 64-bit.

See doc/tutorial.txt for a step-by-step guide on how to build, install and 
use KernelStrider.
