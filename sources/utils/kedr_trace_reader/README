				KEDR_TRACE_READER
C++ library for read trace generated by the KEDR.


Really, KEDR use CTF format for the trace, so CTF_READER library is mainly
used for read KEDR trace.

The only this, which that library introduce - way for iterate over the
all events in the trace from the older one to the newest one.

For this purpose, one should firstly create KEDRTraceReader object, passing
directory of the trace to it.

Then iterator KEDRTraceReader::EventIterator should be used, in a way
similar to CTFReader::EventIterator.
