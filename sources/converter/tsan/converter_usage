Usage:

    kedr_trace_converter_tsan [options] <trace-directory>

Convert trace, generated by the KernelStrider, into format accepted by
ThreadSanitizer data race detector(offline variant).

Generated trace is output into STDOUT.


Options may be:
    
    --resolve-pc
        events in generated trace will be prepended with comment of format
        
            # <PC>:<section>+<offset>
        
        which resolve program counter used in followed event.
        
        This option requires options with sections and module files.
    
    --fix-lock
        For every event of memory access type check that it has not 'lock'
        prefix. If that prefix is exist, corresponded event is treated as
        locked memory access.
        
        The thing is that on uniprocessor machine of x86 family 'lock'
        prefixes may be dropped when module is loaded into kernel.
        Because of that KernelStrider interprets that instructions as
        non-locked, and produce trace which may reveal races on that accesses.
    
        This option requires options with sections and module files.
        
    --fix-all
        Also take into account architecture-dependent and other features,
        which may change meaning of events in KernelStrider trace.
        
        Currently this option is equivalent to '--fix-lock'.
    
        This option requires options with sections and module files.
    
    -S/--sections <sections-file>
        Issue sections file which corresponds to the trace.
        This file is needed for some other options to work.
    
    -m/--module <module-file>
        Issue module file which corresponds to the trace.
        This file is needed for some other options to work.

    -h/--help
        Print given usage and exit.
