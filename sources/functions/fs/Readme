This plugin implements models for file system operations, character device
operations and more.

Most of these models require interception of callbacks, so KEDR COI is used 
here to achieve that. Details on KEDR COI:

To build the plugin, "KEDR_COI_INSTALL_DIR" parameter should be passed
to CMake at configuration stage. This parameter should contain the path 
where KEDR COI is installed (or will be installed before building the 
plugin). In particular, if KEDR COI itself was configured to install to the 
default location (/usr/local), you just need to specify 
-DKEDR_COI_INSTALL_DIR=/usr/local when you call CMake for KernelStrider.
