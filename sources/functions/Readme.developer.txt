(For the developers of Kernel Strider)

This part is for the stuff related to the handling of the functions the 
calls to which should be intercepted when collecting the data. The code of 
the pre- and post handlers should be placed here. Or, more likely, the 
templates of that code and the relevant data files will be here along with 
the instructions on how to generate the code from all this.
