Plugins modules which implement models for different subsystems.

Most models require interception of callbacks, so modules implemented
them use KEDR COI for implementation.
For build these modules, KEDR_COI_INSTALL_DIR parameter should be passed
to CMake at configuration stage. This parameter should contain path, at
which KEDR COI is installed or will be installed before building modules.
