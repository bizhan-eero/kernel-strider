(For the developers of Kernel Strider)

This part is based on what is used in KEDR project. We should strive to 
keep it as close to the relevant part of the KEDR sources as possible to 
simplify maintenance. 

If it is decided to merge the two project in the future, it will be easier 
to perform if these parts have little or no difference.
