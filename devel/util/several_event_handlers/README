Patch to 'core' subsystem of KernelStrider which allows to register several events handlers instead of only one.

It may be useful in debugging of 'output' subsystem for compare its results with ones of simple recorder(utils/simple_recorder).


				How to apply patch

1)add 'event_handlers_splitter.c' into 'sources/core'.

2)apply 'patch' for CMakeLists.txt and module.c files under 'sources/core' directory.
  Or that files may be changed by hand.
  

NOTE: With patched 'core' subsystem all tests are passed except
      'mem_core.register.02' and 'mem_core.register.03': these tests are failed
      because them assume that only one event handler may be registered at once.
