Here are the patches to the respective kernel versions that add support for
KEDR annotations.

Note that the annotations are not enabled by default. To enable them,
set CONFIG_KEDR_ANNOTATIONS=y ("Enable annotations to make KEDR tools more
accurate" in "Kernel Hacking" section of the kernel configuration) and
rebuild the kernel.
