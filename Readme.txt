KernelStrider project provides the tools to collect data about the operation of Linux kernel modules (device drivers, file system modules, etc.) in runtime. The tools collect information about the memory accesses and function calls that the target kernel modules make. The information is passed to the user space for further processing. KernelStrider is tailored to providing data for offline data race detectors (like ThreadSanitizer offline). This allows detecting the concurrency issues of this kind in the Linux kernel modules.
